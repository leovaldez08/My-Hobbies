        In today’s fast and competitive world, we often get time for ourselves.
        Over time, our schedule gets very dull and monotonous. That is why we
        need to indulge in something in between to keep our minds fresh and
        active. What’s better than a hobby for this? One of the main benefits of
        having a hobby is that it is a major stress-buster. You actually enjoy
        doing it and it satisfies your soul.
      </p>

        In other words, without a hobby, your life becomes an unhealthy cycle
        lacking any excitement or spark. Hobbies offer you a great opportunity
        to take a break and forget the worries of your life. They allow you to
        explore yourself and realize your potential in different areas.

        Here are few hobbies of mine which I love to do when I'm bored or when I
        can spare some free time:

        Every time I wear my boxing gloves, I can feel the flow of adrenaline
        rushing through my body. Boxing is something challenging, as you have to
        be able to strike your opponents and at the same time to defend
        yourself. It’s great exercise and there’s nothing more refreshing than a
        warm shower after a hard workout. Once you learn the basic techniques
        and to defend yourself in a proper way, you’re ready to jack yourself in
        the ring, if you want to achieve greatness in boxing. I was about 11
        years old when my father taught me the most basic move, “the jab”. Quick
        punch with either hand can deal some good damage to an unaware foe. If
        you manage to hit to the right place, you can end the match with one
        simple punch! My father also taught me the basic combination, “the
        L-L-R” or simply left-left-right.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        Like in any hobby, boxing has its good sides and bad sides. Some of the
        good sides are; boxing is great exercise. You’ll have to move your whole
        body to get the full use of different moves, which means that you also
        train your other muscles. You also have to be swift in order to dodge,
        so practicing dodging also trains your speed and reflexes.But
        unfortunately, sometimes boxing can be really harsh and violent and can
        be even fatal too. But for me, boxing is just a hobby. A hobby that I
        love. I won’t use it to whoop any poor guy, but rather to defend myself.
        (P.S: I also know other martial arts like Nunchaku and Silambam)

        Over the years coin collecting has been called the “Hobby of Kings”
        because only kings could afford to collect rare coins. It has now
        morphed into “The King of Hobbies” because everyone can now afford to
        collect coins. Coin collecting is a hobby that can last a lifetime
        because there are always new coins to collect. It started for me some
        years back when I used to take my Dad's coin collection book and look at
        coins of different countries. I started collecting like him in my money
        box and after that I always used to wait for my Dad to get back from
        work so that I can show my collection. Since then, it has become one of
        my favourite hobby.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        This hobby has given me information about different countries of the
        world. I have got to know about important personalities of the different
        countries. It's really exciting to have them and keeping them safe. This
        hobby has made me responsible to take care of important things at very
        young age. I have also learnt dealings of different currencies on my
        foreign tours and save money for my favourite hobby. I feel extreme
        pleasure in showing my collection to others.
